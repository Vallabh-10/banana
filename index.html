					 <p class="para">We all have areas for growth when it comes to emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ is not something we are born with—we must learn it and continue practicing it our entire lives in order to achieve personal, social, and professional success. The more we focus on building our EQ, the better we are able to recognize, understand, and regulate our emotions and to respond to those emotions in constructive ways that allow us to communicate, empathize with others, and overcome challenges.</p>
